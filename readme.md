# About the mod
**Arcane Mysteries - Secrets of the World is a mod focused on enhancing the endgame experience and introducing a new "frozen" theme. We aim to make this mod as good as possible by adding special features such as new enchantments, staffs, and mobs that fit the cold and endgame themes. This mod offers the best opportunity to discover new ores with useful loot, new armor and shields, new food items, and a variety of interesting new items.**
